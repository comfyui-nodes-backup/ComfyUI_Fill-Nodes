| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `FL_NodeLoader` | Simple pass-through node that accepts and returns a TRIGGER input, designed to ensure custom nodes are loaded when a workflow is executed. Acts as a lightweight utility for controlling workflow execution order. |
| `FL_NodePackLoader` | Enhanced trigger node that forces processing on every execution regardless of input changes. Uses NaN for change detection to ensure the node always executes when triggered, providing a reliable mechanism for loading node packs. |
| `FL_UpscaleModel` | Processes images through upscaling models with support for batch processing, precision control, and optional downscaling for fine-tuned results. Features progress tracking for large batches and automatic handling of device-specific optimizations for both CPU and GPU processing. |
